# BellyButtonDiversity

## Purpose
In an effort to display data we collected from our research project, we are using Plotly to create a custom dashboard that is capable of filtering the visualizations for each participant.  The participants are only listed by their Subject ID Number.  This allows for them to easily look themselves up while remaining anonymous.  

## Method
We use bootstrap to customize our web dashoboard.  We also use the d3 and plotly libraries to create an front end user operated dashboard.  We create the script that runs all the logic behind the dashboard in ours charts.js javascript file.

These are the 3 different charts that our visualiztion shows for each subject.



This bar graph shows the Top 10 Bacteria Found in a Subject's Bellybutton.

##Conclusion

This will be extremely helpful for subjects to see if they contain the desired bacteria species that was being targeted for in the beginning of the study.
